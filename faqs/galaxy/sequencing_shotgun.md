**Shotgun sequencing** has several properties that makes it different from Amplicon sequencing

1. Sequence all DNA
2. More information
3. Higher complexity
4. Higher cost

**Puzzle analogy**: think of each organism as a jigsaw puzzle.

**Shotgun sequencing**: we considers **all pieces (DNA)** from all puzzles (organisms); we throw the pieces in a big pile, and need to reconstruct each individual puzzle from this. It is **more complex**, but you get **full details** (functional information) about the picture on each puzzle.
