# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

**C**lustered **R**egularly **I**nterspaced **S**hort **P**alindromic **R**epeats (**CRISPR**)-Cas9 is a groundbreaking technology of recent years. It enables editing of the genome and resulted in a Nobel Prize for Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna in 2020. 

The CRISPR repeat sequences guide the Cas9 enzyme to introduce breaks in DNA. With the CRISPR-Cas9 editing system, a 20 base target region in the genome is added into the CRISPR guide and the Cas9 enzyme then cuts this region.

CRISPR screens provide a high-throughput way to identify genes and pathways that enable cells to survive. In a CRISPR screen all the genes in the genome can be targeted (genome-wide screen) or just a selection (boutique screen). Knockout or activation screens can be performed.

Here we will demonstrate analysing CRISPR screen using data from {% cite Fujihara2020 %}.

# Preparing the reads

## Data upload

We will use fastq files containing 1% of reads from the original samples to demonstrate the read processing steps.

## Raw reads QC

First we'll check the quality of the raw read sequences with [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and aggregate the reports from the multiple samples with [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) ({% cite ewels2016multiqc %}). We will check if the base quality is good and for presence of adapters. For more details on quality control and what the FastQC plots mean see the ["Quality control" tutorial]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}).

We need to trim the adapters to leave just the 20bp guide sequences.

## Trim adapters

We'll trim these sequences using [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html) ({% cite marcel2011cutadapt %}) and its linked adapter format `MY_5PRIME_ADAPTER...MY_3PRIME_ADAPTER`, as discussed [here](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt/issues/261#issue-261019127).

# Counting

For the rest of the CRISPR screen analysis, counting and testing, we'll use MAGeCK ({% cite Li2014 %}, {% cite Li2015 %}).

To count how many guides we have for each gene, we need a library file that tells us which guide sequence belongs to which gene. The guides used here are from the Brunello library so we use that file. The file must be tab-separated and contain no spaces within the target names. If necessary, there are tools in Galaxy that can format the file removing spaces and converting commas to tabs.

# Testing

We have been using 1% of reads from the samples in the original dataset to save time as FASTQ files are large. As counts files are small, here we will import and use the MAGeCK counts file generated using all the reads for the samples.

We want to compare the drug treated sample (T8-APR-246) to the control (T8-Vehicle). We could specify them using their names, which must match the names used in the columns of the counts file, but hypens aren't allowed. We can also specify by their positions in the counts file with the first sample column being 0.

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

CRISPR Screen reads can be assessed for quality using standard sequencing tools such as FASTQC, MultiQC and trimmed of adapters using Cutadapt. The detection of enriched guides can be performed using MAGeCK.
